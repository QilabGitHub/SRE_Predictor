# SRE_Predictor
The SRE_Predictor predicts which enhancer pairs are synergistic regulatory enhancers (SREs). For key genes, such as oncogenes in tumors, they are more likely to be multiple enhancers in ultralong distance. Our multiplexed CRISPRi screen revealed an intergrated two-layer structure of these enhancers. The SREs are critical in maintating the robustness of gene expression upon perturbation. 

# Data availablility
# Running the SRE_Predictor Model
Running the SRE_Predictor model consists of the following steps:
  1. Retrieve enhancer regions for target genes
  2. Calculate normalized spatial contacts between enhancer pairs 
  3. Calculate co-occupancy of chromatin features
  4. Compute interaction score to rank enhancer pairs as SREs

All the main programs are in SRE_Predictor.sh file. Please run the script and get the result from the folder called Output.
